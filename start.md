# WELCOME TO LAZLOPEDIA - THE OFFICIAL DOCS FOR LAZLO DB

### How Does Lazlo Work ?
* In lazlo all underlying operations are performed on javascript object arrays.
* The document(.laz file) as a whole holds an array which is loaded into the cache when the document is accessed for the first time.
* The cache is also an array.
* Each javascript object in the array represents a record.
* Each record is assigned an autogenerated unique _id which contains the creation date (UTC) as its prefix.
* Documents are not human readable as they contain compressed msgpack encoded buffer.
