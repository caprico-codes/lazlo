## LOGGING

#### Lazlo logs are eloquent but brief in nature. Every log starts with the local creation time of the record and ends with the UTC creation date & time.

#### Every log also contains a code which describes the operation in short. These are:
* DBC : Database creation
* DBD : Database deletion
* DC : Document creation
* DD : Document deletion
* DE : Data entry
* DR : Data removal
* DU : Data update

#### View screenshots [here](http://www.lazlodb.gq/examples)
